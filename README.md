# Project 3 - GA SEI-36 - Travel Recommendations Site

My final project at the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly was a travel recommendation site focused on people visiting Sydney for the first time.

The tech stack I used to build this was Node, Express, MongoDB, and the database is hosted on Altas. This project really helped me learn more about how Node works and how it can create templated pages quickly in the browser.

A special thanks to Joel and Alex from GA for all the help with this project and for answering all my questions over the last 12 weeks.
